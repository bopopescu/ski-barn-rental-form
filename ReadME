This project is intended to function as a data collection system for ski and snowboard rentals.
It is still in early development. it should function fully, but has yet to be designed, and is constantly gaining new features.


To use this app you must first set up your mysql database, and the settings of this app, src/skiBarn/settings.py ,  
specifically the database settings on line 79 - 90.

Then open the terminal and navigate to env/Scripts/activate.
ie. env/Scripts/activate

After that, navigate to src using manage.py, in the terminal, and launch the server with  py manage.py runserver

Once you complete these steps, you should be able to navigate to the site on localhost:8000 in your web browser.
